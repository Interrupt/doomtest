# doomtest
An editor for a Doom-like engine, using LibGdx.

The level format is a 2.5d Sector and Line collection like in the original Doom, and tesselation is done using GLUTesselator. No fancy BSP tree stuff happening here yet (or ever, possibly).

## Things that work now
* Sector / Wall tesselation
* Sector / subsector creation
* Surface picking (mostly)
* Texture picking

## Todo
* Save / Load
* History / Undo
* Multiple texture atlases
